# FreeRTOS_lwIP_Vivado_2016
FreeRTOS/lwIP (XAPP1026) for Xilinx Zynq devices using Vivado 2016. This port is compatible with Xilinx Vivado 2016 and was tested on the boards Zedboard and RedPitaya, but should work on a Xilinx ZC702 board also. This repository is based on the original posted by D.Da in the FreeRTOS forum called "FreeRTOSlwIP (XAPP1026) for Xilinx Zynq devices using Vivado 2014.2".
